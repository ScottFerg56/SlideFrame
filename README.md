# Slide Frame
A simple slide show Windows app for use as a standalone picture frame to display photos and videos.
Most importantly, the media folder selected can be updated (e.g. with OneDrive or Synology Drive) while running, with changes reflected in the displayed list.

[This program runs on Microsoft Windows and the .NET 8 runtime,
which will be required to be installed on first run, if not already present on the system.]
